# Top 10 Most Notorious Witch Hunts in History

Let's start with the strange and slowly work our way towards the most horrifying witch hunts on the list.

## 10. The Valais Witch Trials

Valais Witch Trials trials took place in the Valais region of Switzerland between 1428 and 1447. Now, you might be thinking, "Switzerland? Aren't they supposed to be neutral?" Well, apparently not when it comes to witches.

The Valais trials were one of the earliest mass witch hunts in European history. They started when a bunch of locals decided that witches were to blame for, well, pretty much everything. Bad crops? Witches. Sudden illness? Witches. Stub your toe? You guessed it - witches.

The trials were characterized by a variety of bizarre accusations, including claims of flying, shapeshifting into werewolves, and engaging in cannibalism. The local authorities, being the reasonable folks they were, decided the best way to handle this was to start arresting and torturing people. Waterboarding is a form of torture that has been historically used to extract confessions, often during periods like the witch hunts, where individuals were accused of practicing witchcraft.  Well. they weren't all that bad! I mean, they only let you get arrested for witchcraft if a handful of your neighbors—say, three or more—decided to point fingers.

One of the most disturbing aspects of these trials was the use of the strappado. This  torture device involved tying the victim's hands behind their back and then hoisting them up by a rope attached to their wrists. If that wasn't enough, they'd sometimes add weights to the victim's feet. 

By the time the dust settled, around 367 men and women had been executed. But hey, at least the crops were safe, right?

## 9. The Würzburg Witch Trials

The Würzburg Witch Trials took place in Germany between 1626 and 1631 and were known for their extreme severity, resulting in a large number of executions

The Würzburg trials were part of the larger Bamberg witch trials, but they deserve their own spot on this list because of their sheer brutality and scope. Over the course of five years, around 900 people were executed for witchcraft. And when I say people, I mean men, women, children, and even a few pets for good measure. Because apparently, in 17th century Germany, even Fluffy could be in league with Satan.

One specific case involves a seven-year-old girl named Brigitta Horner, who was accused in 1639 of attending witch sabbats and making a pact with the Devil. Her accusations led to the identification of other alleged witches, highlighting how children were sometimes used to further witch hunts against adults

The preferred method of execution in Würzburg was burning at the stake. But don't worry, they were humane about it. Sometimes they'd strangle the condemned before lighting the fire. You know, as a courtesy.

The trials only ended when Sweden invaded Germany during the Thirty Years' War. I guess even witch hunters have to take a break when there's a full-scale invasion going on.

## 8. The Trier Witch Trials

Coming in at number 8, we have the Trier Witch Trials. These trials took place in the German city of Trier between 1581 and 1593. 

The trials were initiated by Johann von Schönenburg, the Archbishop of Trier. Because nothing says "man of God" quite like accusing hundreds of people of witchcraft and having them executed.

What made the Trier trials particularly nasty was that no one was safe. Rich, poor, young, old - if someone pointed a finger at you and yelled "witch," you were in for a world of hurt. Even judges and clergy members found themselves on the wrong end of an accusation.

One of the most notable victims was Dietrich Flade, a judge and rector of the University of Trier. In 1588, Flade was accused of witchcraft himself, a charge that arose partly from his opposition to the escalating persecution. Accusations against him included attending witch sabbats and engaging in malevolent acts, such as crop destruction and cannibalism. Despite fleeing Trier, he was captured and put on trial in August 1589. Under extreme torture, Flade confessed to various crimes, including his alleged involvement in witchcraft, and named supposed accomplices, which was a common tactic used by torturers to extract confessions.On September 18, 1589, after a trial that garnered significant attention, Flade was executed by burning at the stake.

The methods of torture used in Trier were particularly creative. They had this thing called the "leg screw," which was exactly as pleasant as it sounds. They'd place the victim's leg between two spiked metal plates and then slowly tighten them. It was like getting a really aggressive massage, if the masseuse was trying to turn your leg into hamburger meat.

By the time the trials ended, around 368 people had been executed. But don't worry, the church made sure to confiscate all their property before killing them. Waste not, want not, right?


## 7. The North Berwick Witch Trials

Coming in at number 7, we have the North Berwick Witch Trials. These trials took place in Scotland between 1590 and 1592, and they're special because they involved royalty. 

It all started when King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) had a bit of trouble on his voyage to marry Anne of Denmark. The ship carrying Anne was forced to turn back due to bad weather, and when James sailed to get her, his ship also faced storms. Now, most people would blame the weather or maybe the captain's poor navigation skills. But not our James! No, he decided it must be witchcraft. Those storms were blamed on witches from North Berwick, who were accused of attempting to harm the king through supernatural means. The first notable accusation came from David Seton, a local magistrate, who suspected his maidservant, Geillis Duncan, of witchcraft. Under torture, Duncan confessed to participating in witchcraft and named others involved, igniting a wider witch hunt.

 Over 70 people were accused, and many were tortured in ways that would make your skin crawl. The star of this show was Agnes Sampson, a midwife who was accused of leading a coven of 200 witches. 

They tortured Agnes using a device called the "witch's bridle." This little piece of headgear was made of iron with four prongs that were forced into the mouth, two pressing against the tongue and two against the cheeks. It was then tied to the wall of the cell, forcing the victim to stand motionless for days. At last the victim would die from sleep deprivation and excruciating pain.

The North Berwick witch trials show how political scheming and fear led to brutal witch hunts in early modern Scotland. They remind us of the dangers of mass hysteria and unchecked power, especially through the actions of King James VI and the justice system back then. These trials are a reminder of how people accused of witchcraft were treated and the dark stories that emerged from those times.

## 6. The Basque Witch Trials

At number 6, we have the Basque Witch Trials. These trials took place between 1609 and 1611 in the Basque region of Spain and France. It was one of the largest and last major witch hunt conducted by the Spanish Inquisition.

This witch hunt was so intense that it spread across the border, affecting both countries. The whole thing was kicked off by a 13-year-old girl named Maria de Ximildegui. She claimed she'd been taken to witch meetings, which apparently were all the rage back then. This sparked a panic that spread across the Pyrenees into Spanish Basque Country. 

The Spanish Inquisition decided to investigate. And by "investigate," I mean "torture people until they confessed." They were so thorough that they even managed to get confessions from people who weren't even there. 

One of the most horrifying aspects of these trials was the concept of the "aquelarre" or witches' sabbath. Accused witches were forced to confess to attending these meetings where they allegedly worshipped the devil, ate babies, and engaged in wild orgies. 

The methods of torture used during these trials were particularly creative. One favorite was the "garrucha," where the victim's hands were tied behind their back, and they were hoisted up by a rope and left hanging. Sometimes, weights were added to their feet. It was like the world's most painful piñata party except the candies.

In the end, around 7,000 cases were examined. Luckily, only about 11 people were executed. The rest? Oh, they just had to live with the trauma, social ostracism, and the constant fear of being accused again.

## 5. The Pendle Witch Trials

Rounding out the middle of our list at number 5, we have the Pendle Witch Trials of 1612. This one's got everything: family rivalries, child witnesses, and good old-fashioned English justice.

It all started with a family feud between the Demdike and Chattox clans. Both families had a reputation for practicing magic, which was fine until someone decided to use it for murder.

The star witness? Nine-year-old Jennet Device. Because if there's one thing that screams "reliable testimony," it's a child who's been coached by adults with an agenda. Her evidence led to the execution of her own family members. 


The accused were held in a hole in the ground called the "Witches Well" at Lancaster Castle. It was basically a damp, dark pit where prisoners were thrown in and left to rot until their trial. Imagine being stuck in a muddy hole for months, knowing that your fate rests in the hands of a 9-year-old with a grudge.

In total, ten people were hanged at Lancaster Castle. But don't worry, they got a trial first. And by "trial," I mean "a chance to confess before being sentenced to death." 

This whole fiasco was recorded in a book called "The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster." This book is a crucial account of the Pendle witch trials. Commissioned by the judges of the trials, this book details the accusations, testimonies, and outcomes of the trials, particularly focusing on twelve individuals from the Pendle area accused of witchcraft.




## 4. The Bamberg Witch Trials

The Bamberg witch trials, occurring from 1626 to 1631 in the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg, Germany, represent one of the largest and most notorious witch trials in European history.

The Bamberg trials were led by Prince-Bishop Johann Georg II Fuchs von Dornheim. This guy was so into witch hunting that he built a special witch prison called the Drudenhaus. The Drudenhaus was equipped with state-of-the-art torture chambers where accused witches were subjected to all sorts of fun activities.

One of their favorite methods was the strappado. They'd tie the victim's hands behind their back, hoist them up by a rope, and then suddenly drop them, dislocating their shoulders.

But wait, there's more! They also had this thing called the "witch chair." It was an iron chair covered in spikes that the victim was strapped into. Then they'd light a fire under it. The pain inflicted was so unbearable that many victims would confess to witchcraft or implicate others, often just to end their suffering.

By the time the trials ended, around 900 people had been executed. Men, women, children - nobody was safe. Even the chancellor of the Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and his family were executed during the witch trials, illustrating that close connections to powerful figures did not protect individuals from accusations of witchcraft during that period.

## 3. The Würzburg Witch Trials

Coming in at number 3, we have... wait, didn't we already talk about Würzburg? Well, turns out these trials were so bad they deserve two spots on our list. Let's dive deeper into the madness.

Remember how we mentioned they executed a 7-year-old girl? Well, that was just the tip of the iceberg. The Würzburg trials were so intense that they started executing entire families. During the witch trials, families could be accused of witchcraft suddenly and without warning, often leading to severe and unjust consequences.

One of the most disturbing aspects of these trials was the "witch test." They'd tie up the accused and throw them into water. If they floated, they were a witch and would be executed. If they sank and drowned, well... at least they died innocent, right? It was a real lose-lose situation.

During the Würzburg Witch Trials, accusations and executions extended beyond humans to animals such as cats and dogs, as well as inanimate objects. This indicates the extent of the hysteria and paranoia, where even everyday items could be suspected of witchcraft.. Better keep an eye on that suspiciously evil-looking chair in the corner!

## 2. The Torsåker Witch Trials

Runner-up on our list is the Torsåker Witch Trials from Sweden. These trials took place in 1675 and are notable for their sheer efficiency. In just one day, 71 people were executed. Talk about productivity!

The trials were led by a man named Laurentius Christophori Hornæus. This guy was so zealous in his witch hunting that he managed to convince an entire town that they were overrun with witches. His secret weapon? Child witnesses. Because nothing says "reliable testimony" quite like a scared, easily manipulated child.

The accused were subjected to the "water test," similar to the one in Würzburg. But here's the twist - they'd tie the right thumb to the left big toe and the left thumb to the right big toe before throwing them in. If they floated, they were a witch. If they sank... well, you know the drill.

The executions took place on a hill that became known as "Häxberget" or "Witch Hill." The condemned were beheaded and then their bodies were burned. 

The most tragic part? By the end of the trials, there were entire villages where no adult women were left alive. Because apparently, in 17th century Sweden, having two X chromosomes was probable cause for witchcraft.

## 1. The Salem Witch Trials

And finally, we've reached number 1 on our list - the infamous Salem Witch Trials. Taking place in colonial Massachusetts between February 1692 and May 1693, these trials have become synonymous with witch hunts and mass hysteria.

The trials were ignited by a combination of factors, including religious extremism, social rivalries, and economic stress in the Puritan community. The immediate catalyst was the mysterious illness of several young girls in Salem Village, including Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, who exhibited strange behaviors and claimed to be afflicted by witchcraft.

Giles Corey, an English-born farmer, became a significant figure during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. After his wife, Martha, was accused of witchcraft, Corey himself was arrested and charged. Refusing to plead, believing the court was corrupt, he was subjected to a brutal form of torture where heavy stones were pressed onto his chest. Corey endured this punishment for three days before dying on September 19, 1692. Legend has it that his last words were "More weight." His defiance has since become a symbol of the injustices of the trials, highlighting the dangers of mass hysteria and the harsh judicial practices of the time.

The preferred method of execution in Salem was hanging. Because apparently, if you're going to kill innocent people, you might as well do it in a way that's both horrific and provides a great view for the whole family.

By the time the dust settled, 19 people had been executed by hanging, one pressed to death, and at least five had died in prison.

And there you have it, folks - the top 10 most notorious witch hunts in history. Next time you think your neighbors are giving you the evil eye, just remember - it could be worse. They could be accusing you of dancing with the devil and eating babies.
