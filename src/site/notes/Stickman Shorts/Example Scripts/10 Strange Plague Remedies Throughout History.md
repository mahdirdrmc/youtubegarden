# **10 Strange Plague Remedies Throughout History**

Let's start with the strange and slowly work our way towards the most horrifying things on the list.

## 10. The Four Thieves Vinegar

Legend has it that a group of four thieves would loot and ransack the homes of people who had recently died from the plague. They would go on to steal from dozens of victims without any of them ever getting sick. They stayed safe by rubbing a secret potion over their entire bodies.

Eventually, these thieves were caught and apprehended by the authorities. They were offered their freedom in exchange for the recipe of this secret potion, which they revealed to be a mixture of vinegar, garlic, herbs, and spices.

No one knows for certain if the story is true, but this was a very popular tale during this time period. This would lead merchants to go door-to-door selling this vinegar mixture as a preventative for the plague. Buyers were instructed to rub this potion on their hands, ears, and temples. But if the merchant had them hook, line, and sinker, he would simply tell them to lather it over their entire bodies. Since everyone knows the number one rule in sales is always upsell when you can.

Surprisingly, this potion would work really well against the Bubonic plague, thanks to the mixture containing the herb mugwort, which is a natural bug repellent. Since the Bubonic plague was spread from the fleas of infected rodents, this would prove to be one of the very few remedies that actually worked.

But sadly, fleas were not the only way of contracting the Black Death. The second method, being much more deadly, was most commonly spread from human to human. This would be known as the pneumonic plague, which often carried a 100% mortality rate. This form usually spreads when a person inhales the airborne droplets of an infected person, which caused the disease to infect the lungs. Of course, the potion would prove to be completely useless against this form of infection.

## 9. Quack Doctors

Throughout history, when the Black Plague would break out, those with financial means would flee from cities and escape to the countryside. This would, of course, include the majority of the city's doctors, leaving behind a massive and lucrative market for quacks.

These quack doctors would post up on city corners selling powders, potions, magical cures, and anything else that they could think of. They would yell at the top of their lungs at people walking by, letting them know that they were selling the latest and greatest cures or preventatives for the plague or any other ailments.

Here's a list of some of the most common items that a quack doctor would sell throughout history:
- Snake oil
- Chill and fever tonic
- Miracle elixir that cured pretty much everything
- Ointments that would cure baldness
- And my favorite: a tincture that would restore life in the event of sudden death

## 8. Urine

Back during the medieval period, urine had a great reputation since it was thought to have cleansing and healing properties. So naturally, it would be used as a form of treatment for the plague.

Anyone infected with the disease was encouraged to take a bath with clean urine to relieve some of their painful symptoms. The urine would be collected from healthy people and sold to the sick, where it was then added to their bathwater or, better yet, consumed directly from the glass.

## 7. Miasma Theory

One of the most popular theories at this time was that the plague was contracted by inhaling bad air or simply put, bad odors. The long list of these bad smells included organic and human waste, decaying flesh, contaminated water, and of course, the Dutch oven, which was a guaranteed way to be put on trial for attempted murder.

Bad smells were believed to carry contaminated air which, once inhaled, would lead to illness. The public was encouraged to carry around flowers, rose petals, or herbs, which they would often hold to their nostrils since they believed that the sweet smell would cancel out the bad air.

This is one of the reasons plague doctors would wear these terrifying masks, since the beak would be filled with flowers and spices which they believed helped keep the disease at bay. But of course, these wonderful smells did absolutely nothing in preventing people from catching the plague. If anything, it just gave people a false sense of security.

## 6. Leeches

Leeches were commonly used by the wealthy as a form of bloodletting and were relatively painless considering what the alternative was. Bloodletting is when blood is drained from a patient, usually from an incision or using leeches.

The leeches would be placed on a person's body while they kick back, relax, and let the leeches go to town. The theory behind this was that the leeches would suck out the bad blood, which was thought to cause illness. But the irony is that the leech's bite was the thing that could make them ill since it always carried the chance of developing an infection.

## 5. The Vicary Method

The Vicary method was named after Thomas Vicary, the English doctor who invented the technique. This would become one of the most popular cures during the plague.

This first begins with a healthy chicken having its bottom plucked clean. The chicken's back door is then placed directly on a sick person's buboes and strapped down to keep it in place. The logic behind this was based on the belief that chickens breathe through their back door, so in theory, it would suck out and absorb the sickness from the person.

If the chicken contracts the plague from the human and begins to show signs of illness, people would often take this as a sign that the remedy was working. If the chicken happens to die before the human, another chicken simply takes its place.

## 4. Flagellation

In Europe during the medieval period, religion was deeply ingrained into all aspects of life. So naturally, people began to believe that the Black Plague was simply a punishment from God for their sins.

Soon, groups of people began to gather and walk the streets while vigorously whipping themselves as a public display of repentance. These groups would use leather whips with knotted cords, but some showoffs would take it a step further by adding nails to their whips.

These flagellant groups would recruit others as they slowly walked from town to town, whipping their own backs and carrying crosses. They would do this act multiple times a day. But the real tragedy would come when one of these individuals would be infected with the plague, since they were left to fight an uphill battle with an already deadly disease, and having a weak body that was severely cut up from the self-inflicted wounds definitely didn't help.

## 3. Feces

As time went on, physicians began to try all sorts of bizarre methods in the hopes of finding a cure, with this special paste being one of them. The paste consisted of tree resin, flower roots, and human poop.

This operation would first begin with the patient's buboes getting sliced open, and as soon as the incision was made, it would then be stuffed with the paste, then tightly wrapped and sealed to hold everything in place. Patients would then be instructed to get some bed rest and wait.

Now, if the patient's body part had not fallen off by the following morning, they would for sure be left fighting a losing battle since it had now turned into a 2v1 with the person fighting against the plague and the infection.

## 2. Bloodletting

This was an extremely popular medical procedure that was used from ancient times all the way through the late 19th century. This procedure was, in fact, so popular that during the medieval period, this would often be the first thing a doctor would recommend.

This absolute nightmare would first start with a person getting their arms sliced open and allowing the blood to drain into a bowl. Now, if a cut on the arm made you uncomfortable, don't worry, since you always had the option to have the incision made on your neck instead.

The instruments that were used to slice patients open look terrifying, and they were often covered in blood from the previous patient since being sanitary wasn't much of a concern during this time period. This, of course, would cause many patients to die from infection.

One of the most concerning things about this procedure was the amount of blood that would be drained since it was common practice to increase the amount drained based on the severity of the person's sickness.

Surprisingly, doctors were not usually the ones to perform bloodletting. It was actually a task left for barbers since they were a lot more skilled in handling razors. This is the reason why they began to place the red stripe on the barber pole outside of the building since it would let the public know that surgery was performed inside. Barbers would also pull teeth, amputate limbs, and make holes in people's heads.

## 1. Extermination

This would easily be the most extreme measure taken during the medieval period in the attempt to stop the plague. One of the groups that was heavily targeted were the Jews.

This would first start when rumors began to circulate that the Jews had intentionally poisoned the drinking wells. On September 1348, a group of Jews would be taken as prisoners to Chillon Castle on Lake Geneva. There, they were brutally tortured until one of them would finally confess to poisoning the drinking water, which, of course, was not true.

The information of this confession was then sent to various cities in Germany, and once the news arrived, it began to spread like wildfire throughout many countries in Europe. Thousands of Jews would then be targeted and murdered for this false confession.

It was even documented that Jews from the age of seven and up were all considered guilty for this crime since the belief was that they all had previous knowledge of this plan. Even though the Jewish community was clearly suffering as they themselves were being decimated by the plague, this wouldn't seem to matter to the general public, and the killings would tragically continue.

It wouldn't be until the spread of the plague began to slow down that the murders would too.
